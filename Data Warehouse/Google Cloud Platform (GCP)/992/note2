Today I will talk to you about supervised 
learning, the most important branch of machine 
learning.
The purpose of this presentation is to 
understand introduction to machine learning 
with an example project.

2-
My presentation is divided into 2 parts.
3- 
Basicly, machine learning is to give 
computers the ability to learn to make 
decisions from data
4- 
For example, your computer can learn 
to predict whether an email is spam or 
not spam given its content and sender.
5-
Another example: your computer can learn 
to cluster type of ball by distinguishing 
them based on their color, size and other 
characteristic
6-
Notice that, in the first example, we are 
trying to predict a particular class label, 
that is spam or not spam. 
In the second example, there is no such label. 
When there are labels present and machine 
learns from a dataset, we call it 
supervised learning. When there are 
no labels present, we call it unsupervised 
learning.
There are also reinforcement learning,
in which software agents inteeract with 
an environment according to rewards and 
punishments.
7- 
Let's come back to supervised learning,
which will be the focus of this presentation.
In supervised learning, we have training 
dataset, described variables or features 
and a target variable. And Machine learns 
from this dataset.
8-
Our dataset is commonly represented in a 
table structure such as the one you see.
The aim of supervised learning is to build 
a model that is able to predict the target 
variable.
9-
The goal is to learn from data for which 
the right output is known, so that we can 
make predictions on new data for which we 
don’t know the output.
10-
I will present an example problem to apply a 
machine learning algorithm. It's the application 
for credit card. Commercial banks receive a lot of 
applications for credit cards. 
Many of them get rejected for many reasons, 
like high loan balances, low income levels, 
or too many inquiries on an individual's credit 
report. 
In this project, 
we will build an automatic credit card approval 
predictor using machine learning techniques, 
just like the real banks do.
11-
The probable features in a typical credit card 
application are Gender, Age, Debt, Married, 
Income, EducationLevel, YearsEmployed, etc, 
and finally the the final variable is 
ApprovalStatus.  Zero means rejected, 
One means accepted.
12-
There are two new application and 
we will find the approval result.
13-
Machine learning, that’s it. We achieved 
our goal. Here is exciting and the best 
important part, but There are part before 
and after here. Unfortunately they are 
more boring than here.
14- 
We just made the part inside the round. 
Before prediction part, there is a processing 
data including data cleaning, normalization, 
and Split the data into train and test sets. 
And then after prediction part, there is a 
evaluating performance part. 
We check the accuracy of our prediction.

Thank you for listening.
