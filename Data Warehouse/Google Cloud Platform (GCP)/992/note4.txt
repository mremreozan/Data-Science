Today, I will talk to you about studying 
evolution

Researchers of Princeton University have 
been spending several months of the year 
in this island since 1973. This island has 
two dominant ground finch species, Geospiza 
Fortis, Geospiza Scandens

3- 
Researchers have monitored them every year 
by making pyhsilogical measurements.


4- 
I will work with the researchers measurements 
of beak length and beak depth. We will look 
different aspects of the beak measures 
including it varies over time from species 
to species. And from parents to offspring.

Fristly, I will investigate how the beak 
of Gespiza Scandens has changed over time. 
In looking at the plot, we see that beaks 
got deeper (the red points are higher up 
in the y-direction), but not really longer. 
If anything, they got a bit shorter, since 
the red dots are to the left of the blue 
dots. So, it does not look like the beaks 
kept the same shape; they became shorter 
and deeper.

7- 
The differences are clear in the ECDF. 
In ECDF, we read data as follows. In 2012, 
40 percent of birds had a beak depth less 
than 9 cm. As you can see, the beak depth 
shifted to the right in 2012, we can call 
it variance. The mean is larger in the 2012 
data, and the variance does appear larger 
as well.

got longer (the blue points are higher 
up in the y-direction), but not really 
deeper. The red dots are to the right of 
the blue dots. So, it does not look like 
the beaks kept the same shape; they have 
smaller beak depth. 

9-
The beak depth shifted to the left in 2012, 
we can call it variance. The mean is they 
have smaller beak depth  in the 2012 data.

10-
Now, Fortis has smaller beak depth and 
Scandens has deeper beak depth.

11-
I want to explain why there is a change 
in beak depth. There is a drought in 1976 
and 1977 that resulted in the death of 
the plants that produce small seeds on 
island.The larger seeds required beaks to 
crack them so large-beaked birds survived
and then reproduced. The theory the 
researchers say is this: Scandens birds
mated with the other finch species on 
Daphne Major, Geopsiza Fortis. And it 
brought fortis characteristics into 
the scandens species.

12-
In order to assess  the viability of 
this explanation, we need to know how 
strongly parental traits are passed 
onto offspring.
It appears as though there is a stronger 
correlation in G. fortis than in 
G. scandens. This suggests that 
beak depth is more strongly inherited 
in G. fortis.

Thank you for listening.
