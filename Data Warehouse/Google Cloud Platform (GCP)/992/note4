bigquery So we are selecting the departure 
delay, the number of flights at that 
departure delay, and then the deciles of 
the arrival delay. Our question may be 
that What is the median arrival delay for 
flights left 35 minutes early? And we're 
splitting it into the zeroth percentile, 
tenth percentile, all the way up to the 
100 percentile. We're getting this from 
a public dataset of flights. we get a 
result within seconds. So if we look at 
these data in a summary, we see the departure 
delay, negative 37. We get 107 flights that 
left 37 minutes early. And these are the 
approximate deciles of when those flights 
arrived. So in the zero decile, negative 66. 
The tenth, negative 44. So that actually 
arrived 44 minutes early.
gecis-
now we can actually do some analysis on 
those aggregates in our AI platform notebooks.

a-
I need to add my query and to import the 
Google Cloud platform Python library to work 
within BigQuery seamlessly.
b-
I have to put my wuery results into a Panda's 
data frame df.head, that's going to give me 
the first five rows of what's in that data 
frame. And so, each of these rows is a delayed 
departure by minute. So negative 37, negative 
36, negative 35, all the way down. Number of 
flights, and then those deciles within those 
flights.
c-
and then, within each column is going to be the 
decile zero to 100% of delay for arrival for 
that flight.
d-
and I want to plot this in the notebook. And I'm 
only going to look at departure delays from 
between 30 minutes early and 15 minutes late. 
As flights are delayed, they tend to be, if 
they're more late, they're going to arrive late 
But you probably expected this sense. What I 
really want to highlight in this lab is this 
pattern of doing some kind of large scale data 
analysis over 70 million rows in BigQuery.
