THE STANFORD OPEN POLICING PROJECT (https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/)

On a typical day in the United States, police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops. 
Our team is gathering, analyzing, and releasing records from millions of traffic stops 
by law enforcement agencies across the country. Our goal is to help researchers, journalists, 
and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.

You'll be analyzing a dataset of traffic stops in Rhode Island that was collected by the Stanford Open Policing Project.
it is critical that you first examine and clean the dataset, to make working with it a more efficient process. 
In this chapter, you will practice fixing data types, handling missing values, and dropping columns and rows 
while learning about the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset.

You will use a second dataset (weather.csv) to explore the impact of weather conditions on police behavior during traffic stops. 
You will practice merging and reshaping datasets, assessing whether a data source is trustworthy, 
working with categorical data, and other advanced skills.

	TAVG , TMIN , TMAX : Temperature
	AWND , WSF2 : Wind speed
	WT01 ... WT22 : Bad weather condition

You'll analyze the relationship between weather conditions and police behavior.
