     Every year for the past 40-plus years, Peter and Rosemary Grant have gone to the Gal√°pagos island 
of Daphne Major and collected data on Darwin's finches. Using your skills in statistical inference, 
we will witness first hand, through data, evolution in action.

     For your first foray into the Darwin finch data, you will study how the beak depth (the distance, 
top to bottom, of a closed beak) of the finch species Geospiza scandens has changed over time. 
The Grants have noticed some changes of beak geometry depending on the types of seeds available on the island, 
and they also noticed that there was some interbreeding with another major species on Daphne Major, Geospiza fortis. 
These effects can lead to changes in the species over time.
